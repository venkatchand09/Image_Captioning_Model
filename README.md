#### The CNN (likely a pre-trained model like ResNet) is used to encode the images into feature vectors.
#### The LSTM decoder then takes these feature vectors and generates captions, word by word.

#### ViT (Vision Transformer) Encoder: The Vision Transformer is used to process and encode images into feature vectors. This model is specifically designed for image understanding tasks.
#### GPT-2 Decoder: GPT-2, a transformer-based language model, is used to generate captions based on the encoded image features. The tokenizer is customized to include special tokens for the beginning and end of the sequence.
