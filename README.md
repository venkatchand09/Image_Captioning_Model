# CNN Encoder + LSTM Decoder for Image Captioning

This project implements an image captioning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as an encoder and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network as a decoder. The model processes images to generate descriptive captions, demonstrating the potential of deep learning in understanding and describing visual content.

## Project Description

The project aims to combine the strengths of CNNs for feature extraction from images and LSTMs for sequential data generation to produce accurate image captions. The encoder-decoder architecture used here is a standard approach in image captioning tasks and showcases how neural networks can be applied to multimodal learning.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. The primary dependencies are:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CNN-LSTM-Image-Captioning.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd CNN-LSTM-Image-Captioning
   ```
3. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   If you're running locally:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNN(Encoder)+LSTM(Decoder).ipynb
   ```
   If using Google Colab, upload the notebook and run it there.

## File Structure

- **CNN(Encoder)+LSTM(Decoder).ipynb**: The main notebook containing code for the entire project.
- **/data**: Directory to store the dataset (images and captions).
- **/models**: Directory to save trained models.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of two main components:

- **CNN Encoder**: A pretrained CNN (like VGG16 or InceptionV3) is used to extract features from the input images.
- **LSTM Decoder**: The extracted features are then passed to an LSTM network, which generates a sequence of words (caption).

## Results

The model is trained on a dataset of images and captions (such as the COCO dataset). After training, the model can generate captions that describe the content of input images.

Sample result:
- **Input Image**: ![example_image](link_to_example_image)
- **Generated Caption**: "A group of people riding horses in the desert."
